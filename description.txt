Most Recent Update:

CONTENT
--------------

Added variants to evening and morning ambiences to switch up the potentially dull same-sound every night and morning.

Added underground jungle (day & night) ambient tracks.


CHANGES
--------------

Fixed config-related bugs.

Removed sound packs. Literally no one used them and it made up 1500 lines of painful code.
Converted codebase to use TerrariaAmbienceAPI. TerrariaAmbienceAPI will now be a mod dependency.

1.4 Update:

SO MANY NEW THINGS!

Reverb! You can enter enclosed spaces and hear your beautiful items in reverberated audio! Can be disabled.
Sound occlusion! If you can't "see" a sound, it will sound muffled or blocked out. Can be disabled.
Audio dampening! Going underwater makes everything sound dampened! Can be disabled.

A WHOLE lot of new footstep sounds! (Metal, Marble/Granite, Smooth Stones, Leaves, Ice, Glass, and more!), a lot of the sounds were just outright replaced.
Slimes now make sounds when jumping and landing. Can be disabled.

There are now 2D positional audios that update as you go around the world, these consist of crickets, owls, and other forest critters.
Sounds now play when sliding on ice.

Audio smooth-transition. As you get closer to space, ambient tracks will grow quiet. As you go into the underground, the sound of caves grows louder.
