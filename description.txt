[DEVELOPER'S NOTE]:

Since this is the final update for this mod on the 1.3 version of tModLoader, I must point you over to my discord server (this mod's homepage, technically).
I have already essentially finished my 1.4 port of this mod, for the 1.4_mergedtesting branch. You can join my server and install it from the #terraria-ambience announcements channel.
You can go to https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/actions and install the latest nightly build. You then place the .tmod file in your 'Terraria/ModLoader/Beta/Mods' folder. Boom! Done.
Enjoy 1.4 Terraria Ambience! (By the way, there are more features, like dynamic reverb, sound occlusion, and underwater dampening, along with a few other features on the 1.4 port!)

Anyway, thanks for playing the mod.

Please do note all of the sounds used in this mod have been slightly modified from their originals off of freesound.com for the sake usage.
